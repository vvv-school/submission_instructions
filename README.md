### Create your GitHub account

We're going to use [**GitHub**](https://github.com) and [**GitHub Education**](https://education.github.com) extensively during the school for hosting code and material so as collaborating all together ✨  

Thus, provide a [**full profile**](https://github.com/settings/profile) :bust_in_silhouette: detailing your:
  - _Name_
  - _Surname_
  - _Institution_
  - _Email_ (can be kept hidden)
