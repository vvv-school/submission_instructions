We're going to use [**GitHub**](https://github.com) and [**GitHub Education**](https://education.github.com) extensively during the school for hosting code and material so as collaborating all together ✨

  - _Institution_
  - _Email_ (can be kept hidden)

Once you have a GitHub account, please do the following:

- 📝 Fill in the [**application form**](./application-form.md) with your data. Make sure you specify IEEE membership, if you want to apply for a travel grant or access discounted registration fee.
- :arrow_up: [**Upload**](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) the following files (as **PDF**) to your new repository within the directory [`./uploads`](./uploads/README.md):
